# Determine the Intended Use of Your Product

The intended use of your product is the primary factor in determining whether it qualifies as a medical device under the MDR. This step will guide you through the process of identifying the intended purpose of your product.

## What is the primary intended purpose of your product?

Please select the option that best describes the primary intended purpose of your product:

1. **Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment, or alleviation of disease**  
   - If your product is intended to be used for diagnosing, preventing, monitoring, or treating diseases, or managing their symptoms, it is likely to be considered a medical device.

2. **Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for an injury or disability**  
   - Products designed to assist in managing injuries or disabilities, whether by diagnosis, treatment, or compensation, are typically classified as medical devices.

3. **Investigation, replacement, or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state**  
   - Products that affect the bodyâ€™s structure or function, such as implants or devices used in surgery, also fall under medical device classification.

4. **Providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body**  
   - If your product is used for in vitro diagnostics, such as testing samples like blood or tissue, it may qualify as a medical device under specific regulations.

5. **Other purposes**  
   - If your product does not fit into any of the above categories, further clarification is needed to determine if it qualifies as a medical device.
