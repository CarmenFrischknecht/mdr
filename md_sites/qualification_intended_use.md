## **Medical Device Classification Based on Intended Use and Risk**

Under **MDR (EU 2017/745)**, medical devices are classified into four risk categories. The classification depends on the device’s intended use, the level of risk it presents to the patient or user, and factors such as invasiveness and the duration of contact with the body. Proper classification is essential for compliance with MDR regulations.

### **General Classification:**
1. **Class I**: Low risk (e.g., non-invasive devices such as bandages).
2. **Class IIa**: Medium risk (e.g., short-term invasive devices like syringes).
3. **Class IIb**: Higher risk (e.g., devices that sustain or support life, such as ventilators).
4. **Class III**: Highest risk (e.g., long-term implants like pacemakers).


### **Key Factors for Classification**:
- **Intended Use**: The manufacturer’s stated purpose for the device.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of harm the device may cause to patients or users.
- **Invasiveness**: Devices that enter the body (e.g., surgical instruments) are classified into higher risk categories.
  
For a comprehensive guide on classification, refer to [**MDR Article 51**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#d1e4775-1-1){:target="_blank"} and [**Annex VIII**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745#d1e32-140-1). For the classficiation according to IMDRF refer to [**Classification IMDRF**](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2019_11_guidance_qualification_classification_software_en_0.pdf){:target="_blank"} - Annex III - Usability of the IMDRF risk classification framework in the context of the MDR.

### **Special Device Categories**:
- **Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)**: Standalone software used for medical purposes, such as diagnostic software, is classified based on its functionality and associated risk. [**MDCG Guidance for SaMD**](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2019_11_guidance_qualification_classification_software_en_0.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- **Software in a Medical Device (SinMD)**: Software embedded in a hardware device (e.g., control systems for diagnostic machines). [**MDCG Guidance for Software Qualification**](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/37581){:target="_blank"}
- **In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVD)**: Devices for testing specimens derived from the human body, classified under a separate regulation, **IVDR (EU 2017/746)**, available [**here**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0746){:target="_blank"}
